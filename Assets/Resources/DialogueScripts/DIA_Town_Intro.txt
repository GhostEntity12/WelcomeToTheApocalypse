Death|Neutral|Thank God we're finally out of that swamp.
Pestilence|Neutral|Hey! Rude! And besides, you're acting like this place is any better.
Death|Angry|Could you not smell how bad that place was? I'm sure it's going to stick to me for ages now!
Pestilence|Tired|Ok, calm down. No need to yell at me.
Death|Tired|...
Death|Neutral|Anyway, it looks like we have a few paths before us.
Death|Neutral|We can probably sneak around behind this house, but that might take some extra time.
Death|Happy|We could always just blaze straight through as well.
Death|Neutral|Thoughts?
Pestilence|Happy|Don't know, don't care. I'm just following you around.
Death|Tired|Of course you are.
