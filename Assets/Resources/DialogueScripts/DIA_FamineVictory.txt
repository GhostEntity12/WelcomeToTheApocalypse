Famine|angry|Ah!
Famine|angry|My money! My riches! My beautiful coat!
Famine|angry|All sullied! All gone! And for what?
Pestilence|tired|Oh put a sock in it already.
Death|tired|We came to save you.
Famine|tired|Well, I would hardly call this 'saving' me. I was perfectly content here.
Famine|tired|But you two just had to ruin it all, didn't you?
Death|angry|You'd rather live a life of frivolty and novelty riches that you cannot spend than a life of freedom?
Death|angry|You'd let yourself get stepped on by someone taking away our purpose in life?
Famine|neutral|Yes.
Pestilence|tired|Look, you can get back to all of this when we're done. But for now, you need to help us.
Famine|tired|I assume this is about all of that "True Apocalypse" nonsense then...
Pestilence|tired|You were literally mind-controlled by it.
Famine|neutral|Was I?
Pestilence|tired|Yes!
Famine|neutral|I have no recollection of this
Death|angry|There's nothing stopping us from hitting you again, you know?
Famine|tired|Point taken.
Death|neutral|We need your help. Alone, we can't take this guy on. But together...
Pestilence|tired|Trust me. If we could go to someone else, we would.
Pestilence|neutral|But War's still out there, and it's going to take all three of us to take him down.
Famine|tired|Ah, why not? I suppose there's no harm in trying, hm?
Famine|neutral|Consider me on board.
Death|neutral|Then we march forward to save the youngest.
Pestilence|happy|Don't be too much of a nuisance on the way, or we won't hesitate to leave you behind.
