Death|neutral|Better yet, where the hell did YOU find them?
Pestilence|neutral|To be honest, I'm not really sure.
Pestilence|neutral|They kind of just, you know, showed up at the swamp and listened to me.
Death|tired|So I assume you have no idea of any weaknesses then?
Pestilence|happy|Hit them until they die.
Death|tired|Great. Thanks.
