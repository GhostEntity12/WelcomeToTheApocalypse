The Four Horsemen have fallen
Under the control of a being that calls itself
The True Apocalypse
<sprite="ProgressArrow" index=0>
<br>
Using the Horsemen as catalysts for the end
The world was plunged into chaos
Before its time
<sprite="ProgressArrow" index=0>
<br>
But not all was lost
Death, the eldest, broke free
And has made it her quest to save her siblings,
Get revenge with them
And defeat this "True Apocalypse"
Before the world is ended prematurely
<sprite="ProgressArrow" index=0>
<br>
After saving Pestilence from the swamp she created,
The two sisters set off to find their brother, Famine.
Travelling through a desolate landscape,
Eventually stumbling across a destroyed town,
Nestled deep in the wastelands
